      "description": "This isn't a game mod, but rather a system workaround which makes it easier to install mods. This script will not work on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition. Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher installer, which often requires you to point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems.",

      "description": "With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added dynamic reflections to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.",

On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs 'Finished, Press any key to continue' but does not list any files it deleted, it is not working, and if it does not work it will crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.",

Additionally, DO NOT apply this step with the Steam version of the game, unless you have applied the below widescreen patch!
